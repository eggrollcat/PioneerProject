# Pioneer Project  

This project is based on the 20% Project, an initiative used by companies to allow
employees to pursue personal projects during their paid work time.  

The goal of this project was to learn a new skill, in which I chose to learn  
basic coding with HMTL, CSS, and JavaScript.  

The code contained in this repository documents my progress as I learned basic  
coding. The main project deliverable is a playable Tic Tac Toe game coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
