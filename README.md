# Pioneer Project

This project is based on the 20% Project, an initiative used by companies to allow employees to pursue personal projects during their paid work time.

The goal of this project was to learn a new skill, in which I chose to learn basic coding with the HMTL, CSS, and JavaScript languages.

The code contained in this repository documents my progress as I learned basic coding. The main project deliverable is a playable Tic-Tac-Toe game coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Instructions

Download the code:

1. Click on the green Code button above
2. Download ZIP
3. Extract the download folder
4. Click on the 'tictactoe.html' file to start the game
5. The file should open in a web brower. You can alternatively right-click and open in a  
browser of your choice
6. Once you get the game running, enjoy the aesthetics and have fun. Keep an eye out for the easter egg.
